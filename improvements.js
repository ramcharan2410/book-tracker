// Accessibility: While the site is visually appealing, it might be worth considering accessibility features for users with disabilities, such as proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation support, and appropriate color contrast ratios.
// Loading State: While the site loads quickly, it might be helpful to provide a loading indicator or spinner when fetching data or performing operations that take longer than usual. This would give users feedback and enhance the overall user experience.
// Pagination or Infinite Scrolling: If a user has a large number of books in their reading list, it might be beneficial to implement pagination or infinite scrolling to improve the performance and usability of the book list.
// Search or Filtering: As the book list grows, it could be helpful to provide a search or filtering functionality to allow users to quickly find specific books based on title, author, genre, or other criteria.
// Book Details Enhancement: While the book details page displays the essential information, you could consider adding additional features like user reviews, ratings, or the ability to mark a book as "read" or "favorite."
